# Q-Bank


#### Getting started
This project uses Python 3.6.1 and Django 1.11.3

#### Running Locally
Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine


+ Clone the project 

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/mfalade/qbank
    ```
+ **cd** into the project directory and run
    ```bash
    $ docker-compose up
    ```
    This would spin up a server running on port **8000** and you should be able to view the app on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
